# Adult_Census_Machine_Learning_Project
A project to familiarize myself with various methods of classification employing machine learning algorithms 

The project uses data from the UCI Machine Learning dataset resources, comprising of 1994 census data of whether an individual makes more
or less than $50k per year. Various attributes are analyzed and used in a binary logistic and random forest model to make accurate predictions.

First, a basic exploratory analysis of the data and to determine which attributes or variables would be predictive. For example, we can look at the variables of sex, occupation, relationsihip status, marital status, age, and other variables.

Models are then compared with ROC curves for overall performance.
