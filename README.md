# Adult_Census_Machine_Learning_Project
A project to familiarize myself with various methods of classification employing machine learning algorithms 

The project uses data from the UCI Machine Learning dataset resources, comprising of 1994 census data of whether an individual makes more
or less than $50k per year. Various attributes are analyzed and used in a binary logistic and random forest model to make accurate predictions.

Models are then compared with ROC curves for overall performance.
